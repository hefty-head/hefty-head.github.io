Imagine there's no heaven

It's easy if you try
No hell below us

Above us only sky
Imagine all the people

Living for today . . .
Imagine there's no countries

It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for

And no religion too
Imagine all the people

Living life in peace . . .
Imagine no possessions

I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people

Sharing all the world . . .
You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us

And the world will be as one
