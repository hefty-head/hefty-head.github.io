<h1>I am taking this as a challenge to come up with one hundred words about myself</h1>
<h2>Realistically, they will be mostly about my cat</h2>
<p>He's really much more interesting than me</p>

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/v5qnwNFQbwxPpRLL6">Here's a photo of him</a>
<h3>Here are some facts about him</h3>
<ol>
<li>He is very small </li>
<li>His name is Dusty</li>
<li>He is also very tired </li>
<li>He gets to sleep often </li>
<li>In spite of this, he remains tired</li>
<li>I made him a cake for his birthday last week and he didn't like it so he kicked it around and crumbs got everywhere</li>
<li>He likes to nip at my legs when I come home at night</li>
<li>He has been fed</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you enjoyed these facts, they were all about him</p>
